Drop Game using libGDX
============================
The original intention was to make games for the Android platform using the libGDX, but since it's a cross platform library I decided to try out the desktop and html version.  I will be working on this more to learn what other things it has to offer while working on other games.  The rules for the game is to use the bucket to collect as many blue water drop as you can, but if you hit a red drop, it is game over.

TODO
- Lots of refactoring
- Trying out the Texture Packer
- Add in object pooling
